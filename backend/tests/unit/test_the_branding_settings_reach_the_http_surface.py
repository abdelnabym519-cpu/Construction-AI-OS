"""The two workspace settings, exercised through the HTTP surface that serves them.

``tests/integration/test_app_branding.py`` states the same contract against a real
application, a real database and two real accounts. That tree is gated on push and
pull request by exactly one job, which selects by the ``tenant_isolation`` marker
plus a frozen keyword chain it is documented not to extend - so a test there is
gated only if it earns the marker, which ``backend/pyproject.toml`` defines as
identity being the variable under test.

Two of these assertions earn it and six do not. A refused URL scheme, a merge that
keeps an omitted field, a cleared destination and a page stored exactly as typed
are about values, with an admin merely the actor, and the marker's definition
names that neighbour as one that stays out. Marking the whole set anyway would
spend the marker's meaning to buy a green tick, and marking only the two denials
would gate a refusal without the allow side that proves the gate is not simply
denying everyone - which the same definition insists on.

So the contract is gated here instead, where all of it can be. The branding record
is a JSON file in the data directory and the only gate on the write is a role, so
a bare application holding just this router, a dependency override standing in for
a signed-in caller, and a temporary data directory exercise every rule below with
no database, no registration, no login and no rate limit in the way. That is the
trade ``tests/unit/test_admin_permissions_matrix.py`` makes for the admin
permission endpoints, for the same stated reason: the smallest setup that still
asserts the gate, the shape and the refusal.
