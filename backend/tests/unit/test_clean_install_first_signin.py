"""A person who installs this product can sign in to the account they just made.

The report this file exists for, in the installer's own sequence: a fresh
Windows install, the CLI started against an empty data directory, the first
account created through the sign-up page, and every sign-in after it answered
"Invalid email or password" - including after the data directory was renamed and
the account created again. Nothing else on the screen disagreed: the sign-up had
succeeded, proven by the second attempt answering "Email already registered".

Two independent defects produced that sentence, and they are indistinguishable
from the sign-in form, which is the third thing this file pins.

1. The two ends of the credential did not agree on what the password is.
   ``LoginRequest``, ``AdminUserCreate`` and ``ResetPasswordRequest`` carry
   ``str_strip_whitespace=True``; ``UserCreate`` - public registration - carried
   no ``model_config`` at all, and neither did ``ChangePasswordRequest`` or
   ``DeleteAccountRequest``. A password registered with a trailing space, a
   newline left by a paste or a leading space from an autofilled form was hashed
   exactly as typed, and every sign-in verified the stripped form against it.
   ``bcrypt.checkpw`` answers False forever, and the screen blames the password.
   Both schemas are read directly by
   ``test_a_password_registered_with_surrounding_whitespace_still_signs_in``,
   so the agreement cannot come apart again without that test naming which side
   moved.

2. A dormant account was reported as a wrong password. ``registration_mode``
   defaults to ``admin-approve``, so every registration after the bootstrap one
   is stored inactive, and ``login`` answered that with the same generic 401 it
   uses for bad credentials. Telling somebody their password is wrong is the one
   claim we can be sure is unfounded, because the password had already been
   checked and was right; the retry loop it sends them into cannot end. That is
   the dead end ``tests/integration/_auth_helpers.py`` had to write
   ``promote_to_admin`` and ``activate_user`` to get the fixtures out of, with no
   equivalent available to a person. ``login`` now answers a dormant account with
   403 and the stable code ``account_pending_activation``, and only after the
   password verified, which is what keeps it from being an enumeration oracle.

The shape of the tests follows the graph the report asks about, end to end over
HTTP: sign-up page payload -> ``POST /api/v1/users/auth/register/`` -> service
(bootstrap, role, ``is_active``) -> password hash -> row; then sign-in form ->
``POST /api/v1/users/auth/login/`` -> lookup -> verify -> active check -> token
mint -> response. Both routes are the real ones, with the real schemas, service,
repository and bcrypt, mounted at the paths the browser uses. What is substituted
is the database: a throwaway PostgreSQL cloned from the session template, which
is the only way "a clean install" means anything inside a suite that shares one
cluster, and the reason the bootstrap question is answerable at all.
