"""The startup banner must not tell the user the server is up before it is.

``print_startup_banner`` has exactly one caller and it runs BEFORE uvicorn
starts, so everything the banner asserts about the server is asserted about a
process that has not bound its socket yet. On a first run that gap is not
notional: the boot this was measured on answered ``GET /`` after 50.55s and
``/api/health`` after about 490s, most of the latter being the demo seed.

The banner used to head that with a green tick over "OpenConstructionERP is
running", directly above the address to open. Beside an address, a tick is an
instruction, and a stranger who followed it got a browser error from an install
that was working perfectly.

So what is checked here is the claim rather than the wording: the banner may say
it is starting, and may not say it is running. The last two assertions are what
stop that being satisfied by deleting things - the address and the credentials
are the reason the banner is printed early at all, and a banner that dropped
them to avoid promising readiness would be a worse banner, not a fixed one.
