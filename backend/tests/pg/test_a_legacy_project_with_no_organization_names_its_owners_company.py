"""What the project-scoped reads do when a project's ``organization_id`` is NULL.

``oe_projects_project.organization_id`` is nullable and arrived with ADR 005, so an
install upgraded from before it carries projects whose company is unknown until the
tenancy repair fills the column in. The repair only fills it where the project's owner
has an active membership (``app/modules/users/repairs.py``, the ``UPDATE`` over
``oe_projects_project`` that reads the owner's preferred organization), so a project
owned by somebody with no active membership stays NULL permanently.

Before these tests existed the read path answered that state with silence:
``ProcurementConceptService.project_tenant`` returned ``None``, ``project_frameworks``
dropped the project's half of its union, and a project member got a list containing only
their own company's frameworks. That is indistinguishable, from the outside, from "this
project has no frameworks", which is the wrong answer to give an estimator standing on a
site wondering whose rebar agreement they may call off.

The fallback asserted here is the same derivation the repair writes and the same one a
token mint uses - the owner's preferred active organization, ordered ``is_default``
first and then by age. Using one rule in all three places is the point: the repair's
docstring says the value it writes into a row and the value a token later names have to
be the same organization, and a read path that guessed differently would disagree with
both. Where the owner has no active membership either, there is nothing honest to
derive, so the answer stays ``None`` and the read stays narrow rather than widening.
