"""Shared builders for the row-level-security tests in the PostgreSQL lane.

These tests are the only place in the suite where the tenant policy is observed
rather than reasoned about. A faked connection can prove what SQL
:mod:`app.core.rls_setup` *emits*; it cannot prove what PostgreSQL *does* with
it, and the difference is the whole security claim: whether a policy installed
by this code actually hides one tenant's rows from another when the query runs
as the restricted role.

Everything here therefore runs against the lane's real embedded PostgreSQL 16
cluster, and every read or write that is meant to be policied is issued on a
connection that has done ``SET LOCAL ROLE "oe_app"``, which is how the
application itself enters the policied role in :mod:`app.core.rls`. The
cluster's session user is the ``postgres`` superuser, so each helper also
reports ``current_user`` and that user's ``rolsuper`` flag: an assertion about
isolation is only worth reading if it also shows the reader which role produced
it, and a superuser bypasses every policy silently.

Probe tables are used instead of the application's own. The cluster and its
schema are shared by every test in the lane, so enabling row-level security on a
real table would be visible to unrelated suites, and the six reference tables in
``_NEVER_POLICY`` are deliberately never policied at all. Probe tables are
created committed (a separate connection has to see them), dropped in teardown,
and named so they cannot collide with a model.
