"""The tenant backfill against a populated PostgreSQL database.

ADR 005 moves every ``tenant_id`` in the schema from naming a user to naming an
organization. That is a rewrite of other people's data, so it is tested here
against the real embedded PostgreSQL 16 rather than against a stand-in, for four
reasons a fake cannot cover:

* the rewrite is SQL, and PostgreSQL reports rows *matched* rather than rows
  *changed* - the difference between an idempotent repair and one that reports
  progress forever is only visible on a real server;
* ``NOT NULL`` on ten of the 31 tenant columns means "re-point this value" and
  "empty this value" are different statements, and only one of them is allowed;
* the ledger has to record ``NULL`` as a previous value, which is a fact about a
  real column, not about a dictionary;
* the downgrade has to put a populated database back, and a rollback-only fixture
  cannot tell "restored" from "never happened".

Everything runs inside :func:`tests.pg.conftest.pg_session`, which wraps the test
in an outer transaction and rolls it back, so dropping and rebuilding the tenancy
schema here does not survive the test.

Every assertion that touches the server also records ``current_user`` and
``rolsuper`` (see :func:`_role_facts`), because a result observed as a superuser
is not evidence about the role the application connects with.
