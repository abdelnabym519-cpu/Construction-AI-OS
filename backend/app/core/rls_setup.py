"""Idempotent PostgreSQL setup for row-level-security enforcement.

Runs from the startup auto-migrator when ``settings.rls_enforce`` is on, inside
its advisory-locked transaction, so workers provision it one at a time and a role
without DDL rights simply skips (best-effort per statement). It:

1. creates the non-superuser runtime role ``oe_app`` (request transactions
   ``SET LOCAL ROLE`` to it, so policies apply) and the ``oe_system`` BYPASSRLS
   role for background work, and grants them read/write on all current and
   future tables in ``public``;
2. enables row-level security and installs a tenant-isolation policy on every
   table that carries a ``tenant_id`` column.

The policy is deliberately non-breaking for a first rollout:

    USING / WITH CHECK: tenant_id IS NULL OR tenant_id::text = current_setting('app.current_tenant', true)

so a tenant can never read or write another tenant's rows, while rows with a
NULL ``tenant_id`` (legacy/system rows, and the many columns still nullable
because the app-layer tenant scope is only partly rolled out) stay shared and
inserts that do not yet set ``tenant_id`` keep working. Tightening to a strict
``tenant_id = current_setting(...)`` after a backfill is a later step.

Global reference tables (cost items, catalogs, regional indices) carry no
``tenant_id`` and so are never selected; a defensive deny-set backstops that.

      tenant claim, so ``resolve_tenant_id`` falls back to the user id and every
      user is a tenant of their own. Enforcing then hides a colleague's rows from
      everybody else on the same install, which is why this alone blocks it.
    * ``null_tenant_rows``: rows a strict policy would hide from every request.
