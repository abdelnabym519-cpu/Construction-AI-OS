"""Persisted white-label branding (workspace logo / company name).

The in-app branding editor used to keep the customisation in the browser's
localStorage only, so it never followed the workspace: a teammate opening the
app from another browser, or an invited user landing on the login page, saw the
default OpenConstructionERP brand instead of the workspace's own (issue #272).

This stores the workspace branding once on the server, in a small JSON file in
the data dir::

    <data-dir>/app_branding.json   ->   {"mode": "logo", "logo_data_url": "...", "company_name": "",
                                         "appearance": {"accent": "teal", "density": "compact",
                                                        "menu": {"view": "compact", "color": "accent"}}}

so every browser and every invited user sees the same brand. A PUBLIC endpoint
reads it (the login page has no token yet) and an admin-only endpoint writes it.

stdlib-only and modelled on :mod:`app.core.demo_seed` so it stays cheap to
import and reuses the same data-dir resolution.
