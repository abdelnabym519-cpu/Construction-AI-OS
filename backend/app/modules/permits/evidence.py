"""Gate readiness evidence for module 1 (SPEC rule 19).

Two providers, registered for every area (``"*"``). Which area and which gate
they answer for is asked of module 1's read port at the moment the gate asks
(:mod:`app.modules.permits.hosting`); no area, document or phase code appears
here and nothing resolved is stored.

* ``permits.roadmap_and_register`` (advisory): on the area hosting the roadmap,
  every requirement the gate's target phase needs is filed or granted and no
  schedule conflict is left unaccepted; on the area hosting the condition
  register, the register is complete.
* ``permits.start_and_handover`` (BLOCKING): on the area hosting the roadmap, for
  a gate into a phase tagged as the start of construction, no open before-start
  suspensive condition and every before-start obligation discharged or accepted
  as a gate condition; for a gate into a phase tagged handover or operation, no
  open before-occupation condition and the occupancy permit granted.

Evidence states are met / not_met / unknown. "At risk" (an early start, a
partial permit, an obligation accepted at the gate) is reported as ``not_met``
with a detail that says so: the gate can then pass only as go with conditions
with the area accepted at risk. It is never reported as met (rule 10).

A project with a roadmap whose governance model does not say where permits
live, has no row yet for the document that hosts them, or tags no phase at
all, gets one ``unknown`` item with the reason on every area. A provider that has data must not answer with silence.
