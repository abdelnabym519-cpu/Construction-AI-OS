"""Admin - row-level-security readiness report.

``GET /api/v1/admin/rls/readiness`` tells an administrator what stands between
this database and a strict tenant policy, so ``OE_RLS_ENFORCE=1`` is switched
on only once the report is clean. Read-only and admin-only; it changes nothing
and works whether enforcement is on or off.
