        "document version pinned at submission, the remarks the authority "
        "issues, the responses back, and the final decision, with an SLA clock, "
        "a stale-version detector, a contestability classifier that never "
        "auto-decides a missing norm reference, and a repeat-remark radar. "
        "Jurisdiction-neutral: it models the cycle and its evidence, never a "
        "country's rulebook; regional packs supply the authority vocabularies."
