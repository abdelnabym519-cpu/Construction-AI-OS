"""Gate readiness evidence for project governance (SPEC section 7).

At the gate into the phase that enables construction start, for the area that
hosts plant (both read from catalogue tags, see ``hosting.py``): zero
error-level findings of rule set ``plant_register``; every critical item at
least ``route_set`` with an approved decision paper; every long-lead item with
one fresh basis quote and either ordered or not past its latest order date;
and the frame document attached to a CDE container. One evidence item per
condition, so the gate page says which one is missing.

A project without plant items gets nothing. A project with items whose
governance model does not say where plant sits gets one ``unknown`` item with
the reason, never silence: an empty answer would read as "nothing to check".
