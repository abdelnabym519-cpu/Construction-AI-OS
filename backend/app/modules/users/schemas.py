#: Surrounding whitespace is not part of a password on this server.

#: Both ends of a credential have to agree on what the password is, and until
#: this constant existed they did not: ``LoginRequest``, ``AdminUserCreate`` and
#: ``ResetPasswordRequest`` carried ``str_strip_whitespace=True``, while
#: ``UserCreate`` (public registration), ``ChangePasswordRequest`` and
#: ``DeleteAccountRequest`` carried no ``model_config`` at all. Registration
#: therefore hashed exactly what the field held - a trailing space, a newline
#: left by a paste, a leading space from an autofilled form - and sign-in
#: verified the stripped form against it. ``bcrypt.checkpw`` answered False
#: forever, and the screen said "Invalid email or password": the one claim in
#: the whole exchange that was untrue, since the password was right. Changing a
#: password was worse, because ``new_password`` was stored unstripped and locked
#: out an account that had been working.
#:
#: The rule is stated once here and applied by every password the server stores
#: (``_validate_strong_password``, and ``users.service.hash_password`` for the
#: callers that never reach a schema - a seeder reading an environment variable,
#: the CLI's ``reset-password``) and every one it compares
#: (``users.service.verify_password``), so a schema added later cannot drift out
#: of step with the sign-in form the way these three did.

      - 8+ chars
      - Must contain at least one letter and at least one digit
      - Must not be in the common-passwords blacklist (case-insensitive)
      - Must fit bcrypt: 72 bytes or fewer once encoded as UTF-8

    The value returned is :func:`normalise_password`'d, so what the policy

    able to reproduce. Judging the raw string instead is how a password whose
    length came from a trailing space passed ``Field(min_length=8)`` and then
    locked its own account.

    The byte limit is the one that reads as a nuisance and is not. ``Field``

    anything longer with a ``ValueError`` instead of truncating it - the

    script that is not ASCII (three bytes per character) encoded to over 72
    bytes, ``hash_password`` raised, and the registration answered 500. Refusing
    it at the boundary says what the limit is and leaves the stored hashes
    unambiguous - every one of them was made from the whole password, so a
