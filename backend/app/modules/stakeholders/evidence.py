"""Gate readiness evidence for module 1 (SPEC rule 20).

The module reports five checks under two subjects. ``stakeholders``: register
present, key stakeholders planned, commitments tracked. ``organisation``:
mandates complete, roles filled. Each subject is reported on the area that
hosts it, with its counts in ``detail``.

Which area that is comes from data: the project's own override in the
settings, else the phase model's ``hosts`` tag read through module 1's port
(see ``hosting``). No area code is matched here. The provider never goes quiet
about a register that exists:

* the model hosts a subject nowhere: one ``unknown`` item for that subject on
  the first area of the model;
* the model hosts it, but the project has no document row for that type yet
  (pinned before the model gained it): one ``unknown`` item on the hosting area.

A project that has not pinned a framework has no register and answers nothing.
