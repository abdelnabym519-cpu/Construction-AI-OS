"""Gate readiness evidence for module 1 (SPEC rule 22).

For a gate attempt and one management area: every matrix item that names this
gate (``gate_code``) and this area (``governance_area_code``) must be released
(or committed, or closed) or explicitly deferred with a reason. One evidence
item per area that has such items. An area without items answers nothing when
every item of the gate sits in an area of the project, and ``unknown`` when
some name an area the project no longer has: those items would otherwise be
seen by no evidence call at all. Registered
non-blocking, in line with the ``warn`` default (lead decision a): the gate
page shows the open items, the decider decides.
