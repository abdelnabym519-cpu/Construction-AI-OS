"""Design Options module manifest.

Generate and compare alternative design options for a project side by side. The
module depends on projects and the BOQ editor (each option gets its own priced
bill of quantities) and optionally reuses the BIM hub, element matching, cost
databases, the 5D cost model, reporting and tendering when those are installed.
