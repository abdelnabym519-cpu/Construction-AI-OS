"""Gate readiness evidence of the quality concept (spec section 7).

Asked at the gate into a phase that enables the start of construction, for the
governance area that hosts quality; both are found by catalogue tag, never by
code (see ``hosting``). Three items: the concept is ready to be approved, the
plan has no error findings (rules 1 and 2), and every subject under a
triggering activity has a before survey planned.

"Ready to be approved" is ``in_review`` without error findings, or already
approved or binding. It cannot be "approved": the concept is approved by the
frame document's binding event, and governance publishes that event inside the
very decision this evidence feeds.

Registered blocking, so it must not fail open. Whenever it cannot answer (no
tag in the catalogue, no concept) it returns an ``unknown`` item with a reason
instead of an empty list. Governance never imports this module; it calls the
registry.
