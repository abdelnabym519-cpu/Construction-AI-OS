## 1. Executive Summary

Formwork (Schalung / coffrage / encofrado / опалубка) is the **single most expensive
re-usable line item** on most concrete-heavy projects, yet it is the line item
**most poorly tracked** by general-purpose ERP and PMIS tools. A 240 m² wall-panel set
from a major supplier rents at roughly EUR 4–7 per m² per day; one mid-rise residential
project routinely runs EUR 200k–800k in formwork rental over a 9-month shell phase,
with a further 5–15 % surcharge silently absorbed at end-of-job for damage, missing
ties, and idle days that nobody attributed to a pour. Existing GC software treats
formwork either as bulk equipment (loses the panel-level accountability) or as a
material line on the BOQ (loses the rental clock and the condition history).

This module gives Construction AI OS a **first-class formwork lifecycle** —
catalogue, unit, accessory, order, assignment-to-pour, inspection, movement —
that fits a small contractor running 50 panels on one floor *and* a
major-supplier-scale rental yard issuing 10 000 panels across 30 projects.
It is vendor-neutral by design: the market-leading framed panel systems from
the large European suppliers, the regional steel and aluminium system houses,
and any in-house steel/timber system register as `FormworkSystem` rows; no
manufacturer is privileged. Mobile-first field UX (PWA, scan + tap, offline
queue) is a core requirement, not an afterthought — the foreman, not the
office, is the primary writer of state changes.

---

## 2. Domain Primer (for non-construction readers)

**Formwork** is the temporary mould into which fresh concrete is poured. Once
the concrete has cured (typically 12 h to 7 days depending on element and mix),
the formwork is stripped, cleaned, and re-used on the next pour. A typical
concrete-shell project will cycle the same panels 20–80 times over its life.

Major **categories** the module must represent natively:

| Category               | Example use                                | Daily-rate driver       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Wall (Wand)            | Basement walls, shaft walls, retaining     | m² of formed surface    |
| Slab (Decke)           | Suspended floors, transfer slabs           | m² of formed surface    |
| Column (Stütze)        | Rectangular / round columns                | Lin. m of column height |
| Climbing (Klettern)    | Cores / shafts cast lift-by-lift           | Per climbing unit       |
| Self-climbing          | Tall cores cast without a crane lift       | Per climbing bracket    |
| Table (Tisch)          | Large pre-assembled slab decks, flown      | Per table assembly      |
| Modular framed         | Standard panel grid, steel or aluminium    | m² of panel face        |
| Beam / heavy duty      | Transfer beams, post-tensioned beams       | Lin. m of beam soffit   |
| Shoring / falsework    | Vertical load support under slabs          | Per prop / per tower    |
| Single-face / blindside | Slurry walls, against existing structure  | m² of formed face       |

**Accessories** are the small parts that make formwork work: ties (DW15 /
DW20 / SK series), wing nuts, water-stop ties, cones, anchors, climbing
brackets, push-pull props, tripods, walers, soldiers, corner units, infill
timbers, magnets, chamfer strips, form release oil. Some accessories are
**re-usable** (ties, props), some are **consumed per pour** (cones, sleeves,
release oil). The module must distinguish: re-usable accessories track like
panels; consumables track as inventory drawdown against the project's BOQ.

A formwork **pour cycle** is the smallest unit of useful work the module
models: *deliver → set → align → close → pour → cure → strip → clean → move
or return*. Rental clocks run from delivery to return, not from set to
strip — so leaving panels idle on a slab for 11 days because the rebar crew
was late is a real and frequently un-attributed cost.

**Engineering input** typically comes from the formwork supplier's own CAD
tool; each of the large suppliers ships one. Output is a per-pour drawing
plus a list of panels and accessories. Construction AI OS will not embed
those tools; it ingests their output as a CSV/Excel/JSON parts list and
optionally the IFC of the formwork assembly through the existing DDC
cad2data pipeline.

## 3. Entity Model

All models live in `backend/app/modules/formwork/models.py` and follow
existing OCERP conventions (UUID PK via `GUID()`, `oe_formwork_*` table
prefix, `metadata_` JSON column for extension, server defaults on money
and currency, `created_at` / `updated_at` from `Base`).

Twelve tables total. Numeric money: `Numeric(18, 4)` with `server_default="0"`,
currency `String(3)` with `server_default=""` (service layer fills from tenant
preference — see `feedback_no_orjson_default` and the v3 EUR-default audit).
All money fields are serialised as strings in API responses to avoid the
float-money trap currently flagged across modules in `MONEY_FLOAT_REMAINING.md`.

## 4. API Surface

All endpoints mount at `/api/v1/formwork/`. Responses use the existing
`{data: ..., meta: ...}` envelope where the module already returns lists.

## 5. Frontend Pages

Frontend lives at `frontend/src/features/formwork/`. Routes registered through
the existing `app/router` module config. All strings via `useTranslation('formwork')`.

```

Key behaviours:
- AG Grid (same shared component as BOQ); column visibility persisted per user.
- Row click opens drawer with movements + assignment history (no full nav).
- Filters preserved in URL (deep-linkable).
- Bulk selection enables status change, move, scrap, print-labels.
- Reskin warning surfaces inline (asterisk + tooltip) before the unit goes
  out — yard managers told us this is their #1 ask.

### 5.3 Planning calendar (desktop) — ASCII wireframe

| Idle alerts: 12 panels on Level 2 stripped 5 d ago, not moved (cost: EUR 410) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bars are draggable; dragging recomputes daily-rate impact in the right rail
sidebar and warns when re-use chains break (e.g. shifting Level 4 set earlier
than Level 3 strip).

```

Implementation notes:
- PWA already configured at app root; this view registers a dedicated service
  worker route for `/formwork/field/*` that caches the last `/field/sync`
  payload in IndexedDB.
- Quick-action POSTs are wrapped in the existing `sync_queue` hook (used by
  `daily_diary` and `fieldreports`). Each action gets a client UUID so a
  replay after offline window is idempotent server-side.
- Camera scanning via `@zxing/browser` (already a dep in `bim_hub` for QR
  scanning the markup tokens). Manual entry fallback always visible.
- One-handed thumb zone: primary actions in the bottom 40 % of the screen.

## 6. Integration Points

| Module                     | Direction | Event / call                                       | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `oe_projects`              | depends   | FK + project lifecycle subscription                | Assignments require a project; project archive cascades to assignments. |
| `oe_users`                 | depends   | Role/user lookup                                   | Foreman / yard manager / project manager identity.   |
| `oe_contacts`              | consumes  | Contact lookup (supplier)                          | Order supplier and chargeback target.                |
| `oe_documents`             | consumes  | Document IDs for photos                            | Inspection and damage report attachments.            |
| `oe_costs`                 | consumes  | Daily rate lookup; rolls up to project EAC         | Cost-of-formwork shows on EAC and project P&L.       |
| `oe_procurement`           | bidirectional | Emits `formwork.order.confirmed` -> procurement event handler creates PO; consumes `procurement.po.cancelled` to mark FormworkOrder cancelled. | Auto-PO from rental order; reverse cancellation propagates. |
| `oe_bim_hub` / `oe_cad`    | consumes  | Canonical-format zone / element IDs                | Assignments may reference a BIM zone (level + section) without coupling to IFC parser. NO IfcOpenShell. |
| `oe_clash`                 | emits     | `formwork.assignment.set` carries level + zone     | Clash module flags formwork that geometrically conflicts with rebar / MEP. |
| `oe_schedule_advanced`     | emits     | `formwork.assignment.transition`                   | Schedule tasks tagged "concrete pour L3 core A" can auto-link assignments and surface idle-days on the Gantt. |
| `oe_hse_advanced`          | emits/consumes | Failed inspection emits HSE-relevant incident if severity >= major; HSE inspection covering "shoring / falsework" can short-circuit to formwork inspection list. | Falsework collapse is the single highest-severity event on a concrete project — HSE must see it. |
| `oe_daily_diary`           | emits     | `formwork.assignment.transition` auto-creates diary entry stub | The diary entry the PM has to write every evening becomes one click instead of remembering 8 events. |
| `oe_eac` / `oe_full_evm`   | consumes  | Daily accrual stream                               | Earned-value tracking includes formwork burn vs forecast. |
| `oe_carbon`                | consumes  | Re-use cycle count -> embodied carbon amortisation | A panel re-used 60× has dramatically lower embodied carbon per pour than a panel re-used 4×. |
| `oe_dashboard`             | consumes  | New widget kind: `formwork.utilisation`            | Joins the existing dashboard widget catalogue.       |
| `oe_validation` (core)     | consumes  | Validation rules: `formwork.assignment_open_for_too_long`, `formwork.unit_in_two_open_assignments`, `formwork.return_pending_after_project_close`. | First-class citizen of OCERP's validation framework. |

Event names follow the `module.entity.verb` convention already in use by
`tendering.package.awarded`, `procurement.po.cancelled`, and the schedule FSM.

## 7. RBAC + Permissions Matrix

Permissions registered in `permissions.py` and consumed by `RequirePermission`
in the router. The site-worker role is a new addition to the existing role
hierarchy — implemented as a **role alias** in `ROLE_ALIASES` so the four
canonical roles (`admin`, `manager`, `editor`, `viewer`) stay intact, and
`site_worker` resolves to `editor` with **project-scoped record filters**
applied in the repository layer (same pattern used by `subcontractors`).

```python
permission_registry.register_module_permissions("formwork", {
    "formwork.system.read":              Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.system.manage":            Role.ADMIN,
    "formwork.unit.read":                Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.unit.create":              Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.unit.update":              Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.unit.scrap":               Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.unit.bulk_status":         Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.accessory.read":           Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.accessory.manage":         Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.accessory.reconcile":      Role.MANAGER,    # yard_manager alias -> MANAGER
    "formwork.order.read":               Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.order.create":             Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.order.confirm":            Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.order.promote_to_po":      Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.order.close":              Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.assignment.read":          Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.assignment.create":        Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.assignment.update":        Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.assignment.transition":    Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.assignment.reuse":         Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.inspection.create":        Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.inspection.approve":       Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.movement.read":            Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.movement.create":          Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.field.scan":               Role.VIEWER,     # site_worker alias -> EDITOR
    "formwork.field.quick_action":       Role.EDITOR,
    "formwork.dashboard.project":        Role.VIEWER,
    "formwork.dashboard.yard":           Role.MANAGER,
    "formwork.report.export":            Role.VIEWER,
})

# In ROLE_ALIASES (core/permissions.py)
ROLE_ALIASES["site_worker"] = Role.EDITOR
ROLE_ALIASES["yard_manager"] = Role.MANAGER
ROLE_ALIASES["formwork_engineer"] = Role.EDITOR
ROLE_ALIASES["project_manager"] = Role.MANAGER
```

Effective matrix (rows = permission, columns = role; `Y` = allowed,
`Y(p)` = project-scoped, `-` = denied):

Project-scoped filtering enforced in `repository.py` using the existing
`verify_project_access` dependency (same mechanism as `daily_diary` and
`fieldreports`). Site workers attempting cross-project reads receive 404 (not
403) per the IDOR-hardening pattern established in v4.6.1 R7.

## 8. MVP (2 weeks) vs Full (6 weeks)

### MVP — 2-week single wave

Goal: a contractor with one project and 100–500 panels can replace
their spreadsheet. Users of a supplier's own mobile portal would see this as
an "inventory + check-in" tool, not yet as a rental-billing engine.

| In scope                                             | Out of scope                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FormworkSystem`, `FormworkUnit`, `FormworkAccessory` (no `Allocation` audit) | `FormworkOrder` / commercial layer                          |
| `FormworkAssignment` with simple status (open / closed), no FSM | Full FSM (planned -> delivered -> set -> ... -> returned) |
| `FormworkInspection` with photo (single)             | Periodic-inspection scheduling                                 |
| `FormworkMovement` (delivery / return / transfer)    | `FormworkAccessoryAllocation` audit                            |
| Field PWA: scan, quick mark-set / mark-stripped, flag-damage, offline sync | Calendar planning view, drag-to-replan                |
| Desktop inventory page (AG Grid)                     | Yard dashboard, reports CSV/XLSX                               |
| Seed: framed wall, single-side, girder wall catalogues (~120 SKUs) | Further supplier catalogues                        |

### Full module — 6-week deliverable

Adds (on top of MVP):
- Commercial layer (`FormworkOrder` + lines, promote-to-PO, rental clock).
- Full FSM with FSM-engine integration and event publication.
- Re-use cycle traceability (`moved_to_assignment_id` chain + report).
- Planning calendar (drag-to-replan with rate impact).
- Yard dashboard, project dashboard, dashboard widget.
- BIM zone linking via canonical-format references; clash module hook.
- HSE inspection cross-link for shoring / falsework.
- Carbon amortisation per re-use cycle.
- Daily diary auto-stub on status transition.
- 8 additional seeded catalogues (further supplier systems, generic-steel, generic-timber, in-house).
- Reports: re-use cycle, idle days, damage chargebacks (CSV + XLSX).
- ~120 backend tests, ~40 frontend tests, ~6 Playwright field scenarios.
- Mobile UX polish: one-hand mode, vibration on scan, bulk-scan-then-act.

Estimated effort: 3 backend + 2 frontend + 0.5 product, 6 calendar weeks (30 working days).

## 9. Open Questions for the Product Owner

1. **Scanning hardware.** Do we target device-camera-only (zxing, free, slower in
   poor light), or also support Bluetooth/USB barcode guns and Zebra hand-held
   PDAs that supplier yards already deploy? Hardware support pushes timeline +1
   week and brings native-app pressure.
2. **Tenant model for the catalogue.** Is the `FormworkSystem` table shared
   across all tenants (one shared seed for everyone) or per-tenant (each
   customer can edit their own copy)? Affects seed-loader strategy and how
   community-contributed system seeds are distributed.
3. **Rental-billing depth.** Do we need full accrual accounting (post a daily
   journal entry per unit per day to `oe_finance`), or is end-of-month
   summary roll-up to `oe_costs` enough? Full accrual = +2 weeks and a
   finance-module review.
4. **Owned vs rented separation.** Is "owned-by-customer" a real use case
   (large GCs increasingly own a stake), or are we 100 % rental-yard
   centric? Owned-flow needs depreciation, periodic inspection scheduling,
   and a yard-internal cost-rate alongside the supplier daily rate.
5. **Integration with manufacturer CAD output.** The large suppliers' own CAD
   tools export XML parts lists, and some expose a project-data API. Do we ship
   parsers in this module, or land them as separate community modules later
   (preferred per the modules-as-plugins philosophy)? If in-module: scope
   creep risk + per-vendor format drift maintenance burden.

## 10. Reference Comparison

Supplier customer portals:
- Per-project rental list, downloadable delivery / return notes.
- Outstanding-items list pulled from the supplier's yard ERP.
- E-signed delivery receipts (HTML + PDF).
- No re-use cycle metrics; no on-site condition reports; no offline mobile.
- Built around the supplier's own ERP back-end; closed to third-party inventory.

Supplier planning software:
- 3D pour planner in a browser viewer.
- Parts list export to CSV / Excel.
- Project-level cost forecast that compares planned vs actual rental days.
- Limited mobile (web-responsive, not offline-first).
- Vendor-locked: only that supplier's own systems load into the planner.

Across the large suppliers these vary in maturity, but the pattern is constant:
a planning tool, a yard ERP and a customer portal, each tied to one
manufacturer's catalogue. All vendor-locked; none of them expose the inventory
through an open API that a general contractor's PMIS could consume.

Construction AI OS **Formwork module** target differentiation:
- Vendor-neutral catalogue (every major manufacturer + in-house systems coexist).
- Offline-first mobile worker UX (PWA + sync queue, not a portal).
- Re-use cycle is a first-class metric (none of the above expose it cleanly).
- Open REST API + event bus, integrates with the same project a customer uses
  for BOQ / schedule / HSE / EAC — no silo.
- AGPL community edition with optional commercial; open data export
  (CSV / XLSX / JSON) at every screen.

The module's strategic claim: a contractor renting from any of the large
suppliers can run this module on top of their existing rental contracts and
unify what today lives in three vendor portals plus an Excel sheet on the
foreman's desktop.

## Appendix B — Risks

- **Scope creep into rental-yard ERP.** The large suppliers' full yard ERPs took
  decades to mature. We commit to the *general contractor* and *small rental
  yard* persona only; we do not chase full warehouse-management features
  (bin slotting, asset-photo training pipelines, automated reorder points).
- **Supplier CAD / portal integration drift.** Per Q5, we lean on
  community-module pattern to absorb format churn outside the core.
- **Mobile reliability.** Offline-first is hard; the daily-diary module's
  sync queue is the proven internal reference and must be re-used, not
  re-implemented.
- **Multi-currency rental.** A Swiss tenant ordering panels from a German
  yard runs CHF site / EUR contract; the existing currency-discipline
  (string serialisation, server-default `""`, service layer fills from
  tenant preference) carries forward unchanged.
