# Construction AI OS - Windows Defender fix for Qdrant snapshot restore.
#
# Why this exists:
# Qdrant 1.18+ writes a WAL clock file (newest_clocks.json) during snapshot
# recovery and calls fsync() on it. On native Windows, Defender's real-time
# scanner briefly holds a handle on the file as soon as it appears on disk
# and Qdrant gets ACCESS_DENIED (os error 5) before the scan releases.
# The download succeeds - only the final disk sync fails - and Qdrant
# rolls back the entire restore. Install hangs / errors with
# "Qdrant could not fetch or restore the snapshot ..." even though the
# bytes arrived fine.
#
# How to use:
# 1. Right-click this file -> "Run with PowerShell".
# 2. Approve the UAC prompt that appears.
# 3. Return to the app and click "Install" again on the catalogue card.
#
# Nothing is uninstalled or reconfigured - we only add ~/.openestimator
# to Defender's exclusion list. To remove the exclusion later, open an
# elevated PowerShell and run:
#   Remove-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:USERPROFILE\.openestimator"
