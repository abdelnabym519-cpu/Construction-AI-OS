"""Start the product the way an installer starts it, and prove it answers.

The pytest lanes cannot see a startup-ordering defect. Every backend shard runs
with ``DATABASE_URL`` already in the environment - the Linux shards point it at
a postgres:16 service container, and conftest honours an already-set URL instead
of booting the embedded cluster - so a ``Settings`` object built before the
cluster exists already carries a working URL and a stale cache is harmless. The
product can be broken for everybody who installs it and still show twenty green
jobs. That happened: ``app/database.py`` builds its engine from
``get_settings()`` at import time, the CLI reads settings while it builds its
argument parser, and every cold start died with "DATABASE_URL must be a
PostgreSQL URL" while the cluster was up.

This probe is the lane that cannot be fooled that way. It refuses to run at all
if ``DATABASE_URL`` or ``DATABASE_SYNC_URL`` is already set, because on a
runner that already has one this test would prove nothing. It then starts the
real command - ``python -m app.cli serve`` - against an empty data directory
with demo data off, exactly the first run of a new install, and waits for
``/api/health`` (unauthenticated by design) to answer 200.

Health answering is not the same as the product working, so the probe goes on to
do the two things an installer does next, over HTTP against that same clean data
directory: create the first account through the public registration endpoint and
sign in to it. Both must answer 2xx or the job fails. A server that comes up and
then refuses its own operator is the failure this was extended for - it reported
"Invalid email or password" to a person who had just registered and typed that
password correctly, on an install with nothing in it, and every lane we had was
green because health answered and the unit suite never asks a clean install for
its first account. The sign-in is repeated with the password as registered and
with surrounding whitespace stripped, because the two ends of a credential have
to agree on what the password is and a defect in that agreement is invisible to
both halves on their own. The token that comes back is decoded - not verified,
which would need the signing key - to assert it names a tenant, and then used
against ``/me/``, so a token that cannot open anything fails here rather than in
somebody's browser.

Stdlib only, so it runs on the three runner images without installing anything
beyond the backend itself. The child's stdout and stderr are inherited, so the
CLI's own STAGE lines and any traceback land in the job log verbatim.
