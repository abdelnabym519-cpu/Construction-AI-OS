/**
 * That the sign-in screen actually asks the classifier.
 *
 * `loginError.test.ts` pins the rule itself, and it passes on the pure
 * function alone: delete the `loginFailureKindFromResponse` branch out of
 * `LoginPageNext.handleSubmit` and all 22 of those cases stay green, because
 * nothing in them renders a page. The helper would keep giving the right
 * answer to a question the screen had stopped asking, and the outage wording
 * would silently go back to being "Invalid email or password".
 *
 * So these cases assert the wiring rather than the rule: what a person
 * actually ends up reading, for a response the classifier is supposed to split
 * away from a wrong password.
 *
 * `t` is mocked to echo the key, so an assertion names the branch that ran
 * rather than a sentence that a copy edit or a locale change could move.
