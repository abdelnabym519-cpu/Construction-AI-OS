/**
 * About: which build you are running, and where the licence is stated.
 *
 * This page used to carry the product's marketing - a six-tile statistics row
 * (120K+ cost items, 47 countries, 180+ backend modules, 28 AI models), a
 * documentation card that deep-linked into the upstream repository's docs tree,
 * a full licence explainer with "You can / You must" columns and five badges
 * ("Free to use", "Open source", "Self-hosted", "No vendor lock-in"), a wall of
 * contributor and sponsor tiles rendered from their GitHub avatars, and a call
 * to action inviting the reader to go and contribute.
 *
 * All of that is gone. The owner ships this product as their own, and none of it
 * told a user anything they needed in order to use the software: the statistics
 * were claims, the documentation links pointed at somebody else's repository,
 * and the contributor wall was the upstream project's community, not this
 * installation's.
 *
 * What stays is what an About page is actually for. Which build is running, so a
 * support conversation starts from a fact. What the product does, in one line.
 * The release notes, which are product information about the installation in
 * front of you. And one link to /legal, which is the single place that states
 * the licence, the attribution notice and the source offer - it is not restated
 * here, because two places saying it is two places to keep correct.
 *
 * `data-changelog-anchor` is a contract, not decoration: WhatsNewCard scrolls to
 * it when the user asks to see the full changelog.
